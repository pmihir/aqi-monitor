# Live AQI Monitoring

# Introduction
An air quality index (AQI) is used to visualise to the public the amount of current polluted air or a forcast of it. Public health risks increase as the AQI rises. All the different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards.

User can monitor AQI of 12 different cities using this App. In Application, User can check AQI of different cities and using Bar graph User can compare AQI among different cities.

I have used react-chartjs-2 library which is wrapper of Chart.js for displaying chart. 

It took 4-5 hours to complete this task.
